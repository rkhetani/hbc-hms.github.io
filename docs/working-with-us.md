### Working with us

Consults are billed at **$150/hour** after an initial meeting to discuss your project. This model ensures we can flexibly assign the right combination of expertise to your specific tasks. We will provide you with a estimate of the number of hours required, a quote, and a start date as part of our [Memorandum of Understanding](https://www.dropbox.com/s/epzz9gkt28ix0yg/HBC%20TNT%20MOU.pdf?dl=0) (PDF). During the project you will receive detailed monthly billing updates and ongoing analysis results via a [Basecamp](https://basecamp.com/) project page.

**Fees** for pilot projects, grant-writing related data analysis, and other short term consults **can be subsidized** in many cases through support from the [HMS Tools and Technology Program](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments/tools-and-technology) and funding from the [Harvard NeuroDiscovery Center](http://www.neurodiscovery.harvard.edu/). If in doubt [ask us for more information](#contact)!
