### Bioinformatics Support for HMS

The [Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core](http://bioinformatics.sph.harvard.edu/) (HBC) provides bioinformatics support for Harvard Medical School researchers. This has been made possible through funding from the [HMS Tools and Technology Program](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments/tools-and-technology) (TnT).

Our Core staff are available to help with the **management, integration, and contextual analysis of high-throughput biological data**, focusing on **next-generation sequencing support**. We [provide consulting, training, tools, databases and best practices](#support), while fostering collaboration and a community of bioinformatic activities. We also build unified infrastructure to support a diverse set of experimental systems and high-throughput biological data.

With the help of this funding, HBC can now **offer subsidized [consults](#fees)** to researchers with a primary affiliation in one of the [Basic and Social Science Departments on the Quad](http://hms.harvard.edu/departments). Please [contact us](#contact) with any questions and support requests you might have.
