Next generation sequencing analysis:\n\n\nCore analysts have extensive experience in \nmanaging and analyzing sequencing data\n, including whole genome and exome sequencing (quality control, mapping, re-alignment, variant calls, prioritization), RNA-seq (quantification and \nde novo\n transcriptome analysis), genome assembly (reference guided and \nde novo\n) and epigenomics (450K methylation arrays, RRBS, ChIP-seq).

Functional analysis:\n\n\nWe provide a path from genes to function by delivering extensive functional annotation, prioritizing new markers, and developing testable hypotheses for future experiments. We test for functional information using different gene set enrichment approaches (using Gene Ontology, pathway databases, and curated and generic gene sets), provide context by integrating your data with public resources such as \nGEO\n and \nArrayExpress\n, and explore the biological interaction space in co-expression and high-throughput interaction data sets using network analysis techniques.\n\n\n3.
